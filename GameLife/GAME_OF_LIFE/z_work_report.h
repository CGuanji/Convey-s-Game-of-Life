    Implement:
               Program run as expected
               Neighbor count well, cell dead and alive through every generation
               Circular Matrix to link each border.
               Didn't consider the border instead to set them to dead.
               Randomly reset the Matrix

    Partial Implement:
            N/A

    None Implement:
            N/A

    BUG:
            N/A



    Reflection:
                For this final prototype project, I used double for loop to count its neighbor,
                and use each cell's neighboor to get the next generation of cell.

                I did not use the circular border algorithm professor talked in class, but use a similar algorithm
                to copy the border array down and paste them into another side. The output is good.

                Overall, this project is not hard, but time consuming. Nice Experience to deal with array!
